# Studying the Mastering the FreeRTOS Kernel Online Resource

I followed along with the Mastering the FreeRTOS Kernel online book and created code examples as I progressed. The code is compiled and ran on an STM32F407VG discovery board.

Each commit in this repository represents one of these examples.
